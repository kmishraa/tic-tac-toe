# Tic Tac Toe
Component Structure: Build a structured component hierarchy with a Game component containing a Board component, which in turn contains Square components.
State Management: Use React's useState hook to manage the game's state, including the current player and the state of each square on the board.
Event Handling: Implement click event handlers to allow players to make moves by clicking on squares, updating the state accordingly.
Win Logic: Add logic to check for winning combinations or a draw after each move to determine the game's outcome.
UI Rendering: Ensure the game UI updates dynamically to reflect the current game state, including indicating the current player's turn and displaying the winner or draw state.
