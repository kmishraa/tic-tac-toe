# Tic Tac Toe
<ul>
  <li>Component Structure: Build a structured component hierarchy with a Game component containing a Board component, which in turn contains Square components.</li>
  <li>State Management: Use React's useState hook to manage the game's state, including the current player and the state of each square on the board.</li>
  <li>Event Handling: Implement click event handlers to allow players to make moves by clicking on squares, updating the state accordingly.</li>
  <li>Win Logic: Add logic to check for winning combinations or a draw after each move to determine the game's outcome.
UI Rendering: Ensure the game UI updates dynamically to reflect the current game state, including indicating the current player's turn and displaying the winner or draw state.</li>
  
</ul>
